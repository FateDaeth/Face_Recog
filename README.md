# Face_Recognition Using Transfer Learning


## “Transfer Learning” which enables us to use pre-trained models from other people by making small changes.

### Task :
To create a Face Recognition model either using pre trained Deep Learning models (VGG16 , Inception ,MobileNet etc..) or create own model from start.

So, I used **VGG16 model** which is pre-trained on the **ImageNet dataset** and provided in the **keras library** for use. it saves huge efforts required to re-invent the model (as it requires a huge amount of RAM and CPU ).

**For this activity I have used three YouTube creators as 3 Classes i.e, ( Carryminati , Ashish Chanchlani and Bhuvan Bam )**

I have used 3 Epoch for my project as I have less dataset & I got 93% Accuracy ...you can use as many Epoch for a better Accuracy.
